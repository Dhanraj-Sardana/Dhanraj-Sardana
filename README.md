🎭 **Code Poet | Theatre Leader | Curious Creator | Natural Actor**

I'm a **Computer Science Graduate** who is  passionate about building tools, breaking limits, and blending logic with creativity. From CLI-based dev tools to real-time streaming apps, I craft code that performs under pressure — much like I do on stage as the **President of my college theatre society**.

## 🔧 My Flagship Project: `CollabVS`

A file-based **version control system** I built from scratch using Node.js and Electron. It features:

- Branching, merging, staging, logging, commit history and lot more
- Rebase with conflict detection and resolution
- Remote push/pull with zip-based server sync
- UI-based conflict resolution powered by React + Electron

📁 Think Git, but homemade and hacker-friendly.
